# ~~~~~~~~~~~
# Directories
# ~~~~~~~~~~~

# The new files to sort
# For example, set this to where completed downloads are stored
directory-to-sort=/data/downloads/completed/dummy

# A file to be sorted: this argument can be repeated to add multiple individual files to sort
#file-to-sort=

# Where to sort episodes into (dir that will contain dirs for each show)
# This directory will contain the structure (Show)/(Seasons)/(episodes)
# Alternatively set this to "KEEP_IN_SAME_DIRECTORIES" for a recursive renaming of files in directory-to-sort
tv-directory=/data/tvshows

# Where to sort music into
# If not specified, music is not moved
#music-directory=/home/cliffe/Files/Media/Music

# Where to sort movies into
# If not specified, movies are not moved
# Enabling this feature requires Internet access to look up movie names
movie-directory=/data/movies

# OPTIONAL - where to put things that are none of the above
# If this is supplied then files and directories that SortTV does not match as episodes or music etc will be moved here
# If not specified, non-episodes are not moved
#misc-dir=/home/cliffe/Files/Downloads/Non-episodes

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Which files to sort
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# OPTIONAL - Dry run mode
# No file operations will occur on the to-sort directory, some directories may be created at the destination.
#dry-run

# OPTIONAL - only sort if the file matches one of these
# uses shell-like simple pattern matches
# sort files:
whitelist=*
# sort directories:
whitelist=*/

# OPTIONAL - don't sort if the file matches one of these
ignore:*.uc!
ignore=*.uc
ignore=*.torrent
ignore=*sample*
ignore=*.part
# don't sort compressed files, their contents will be extracted and sorted
ignore=*.rar
ignore=*.zip
ignore=*.7z
ignore=*.gz
ignore=*.bz2
ignore=*.r0*
ignore=*.r1*
ignore=*.r2*
ignore=*.r3*
ignore=*.r4*
ignore=*.r5*
ignore=*.r6*
ignore=*.r7*
ignore=*.r8*
ignore=*.r9*

# OPTIONAL - delete the file from the source directory, if the file matches one of these
# Note: this is applied after an attempt has been made to extract any archives
# Remove the leading '#' to enable these:
#delete:readme
#delete:read me
#delete:*.nfo
#delete=*.rar
#delete=*.zip

# OPTIONAL - consider the file extension before treating certain files as movies or TV episodes
# Recommended: SortTV is aware of a large number of extensions, and this can avoid many false matches
# TRUE/FALSE
# if not specified, TRUE
consider-media-file-extensions=TRUE

# OPTIONAL - These extensions are NEVER movies or TV shows or music, treat them as "others" automatically
# Note: Will not run these file types through tvdb, tmdb, etc.
# Not typically required if consider-media-file-extensions=TRUE
# This argument can be repeated to add multiple extensions
#non-media-extension=idx

# OPTIONAL - sort files which fall within these ranges. Filesizes use the MB and GB postfixes, 
# such as 170MB-400MB or 1.0GB-1.2GB. If no postfix specified, MB is assumed.
# The following ranges can be enabled by removing the leading '#':
#filesize-range=170MB-400MB
#filesize-range=1.05GB-1.15GB
#filesize-range=697MB-700MB

# OPTIONAL - Sort only files or directories that are older than this number of days
# A value of zero sorts everything.
# This may be useful if you rsync your media from a remote server.
sort-only-older-than-days=0

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Output and xbmc integration
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# OPTIONAL - host:port for the old xbmc webserver, to automatically update library when media arrives
# You probably want to set this to "localhost:8080". Remember to "allow control of xbmc via HTTP", and "set the content" of your TV directory in xbmc.
# If not specified, xbmc is not updated
#xbmc-old-web-server=192.168.0.5:80

# OPTIONAL - host for the new xbmc communication, to automatically update library when media arrives
# You probably want to set this to "localhost"
xbmc-remote-control=192.168.0.5

# OPTIONAL - port number for the new xbmc communication
# You probably want to set this to "9090", if that doesn't work, try "80"
xbmc-remote-control-port=9090

# OPTIONAL - log to this file
# If not specified, output goes to sorttv.log in the script directory
#log-file=

# OPTIONAL - Output verbosity. Set to show messages describing the decision making process.
# If not specified, it is disabled
#verbose

# ~~~~~~~
# Polling
# ~~~~~~~

# OPTIONAL - Tell the script to check for new files to sort every X seconds, minutes, hours, or days
# You could set the script to start on system startup with polling, rather than using scheduling to start the script.
# Valid values include "2secs", "2days", "1min", "3hrs", "30s" etc.
# If not specified, polling is disabled and the script will only sort the directory once.

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Download images
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# OPTIONAL - Download images for shows, seasons, and episodes from thetvdb
# Downloaded images are copied into the sort-to (destination) directory.

# FALSE - No images are downloaded
# NEW_SHOWS/FALSE
# if not specified, NEW_SHOWS
fetch-tv-images=FALSE

# OPTIONAL - Sets the image format to use, poster or banner.
# POSTER/BANNER
# if not specified, POSTER
images-format=POSTER

# OPTIONAL - Download images for movies
# Downloaded images are copied into the sort-to (destination) directory.
# TRUE/FALSE
# if not specified, TRUE
fetch-movie-images=FALSE

# OPTIONAL - Duplicate images can be symlinked or copied. For example TV season images get placed in the main directory, and also in season subdirectories.
# The SYMLINK option is recommended. If symlinks are not available (for example, on Windows), then they will be copied.
# SYMLINK/COPY
# If not specified, SYMLINK.
duplicate-images=SYMLINK

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# File renaming
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# OPTIONAL - rename media to a new format when moving
# TRUE/FALSE
# If not specified, FALSE
rename-media=TRUE

# Optional - the format to use if renaming tv episodes to a new format (as specified above)
# Hint: including the Episode Title as part of the name slows the process down a bit since titles are retrieved from thetvdb.com
# The format can be made up of:
# 	[SHOW_NAME]: "My Show"
# 	[EP1]: "S01E01"
# 	[EP2]: "1x1"
# 	[EP3]: "1x01"
# 	[EP4]: "01" (Episode number only)
# 	[EP_NAME1] " - Episode Title"
# 	[EP_NAME2] ".Episode Title"
# 	[QUALITY]: " HD" (or " SD") - extracted from original file name

# If not specified the format is, "[SHOW_NAME] - [EP1][EP_NAME1]"
#
# Examples: (remove the # from the renameformat line that follows the example filename you want)
# for "My Show - S01E01 - Episode Title" (this is the default)
#rename-tv-format=[SHOW_NAME] - [EP1][EP_NAME1]
# for "My Show - S01E01"
#rename-tv-format=[SHOW_NAME] - [EP1]
# for "My Show.S01E01.Episode Title"
rename-tv-format=[SHOW_NAME].[EP1][EP_NAME2]
# for "My Show - S01E01 - Episode Title"
#rename-tv-format=[SHOW_NAME] - [EP1][EP_NAME1]
# for "My Show - 1x1 - Episode Title"
#rename-tv-format=[SHOW_NAME] - [EP2][EP_NAME1]
# for "My Show - 1x01 - Episode Title"
#rename-tv-format=[SHOW_NAME] - [EP3][EP_NAME1]

# Optional - the format to use if renaming movies
# The format can be made up of:
# 	[MOVIE_TITLE]: "My Movie"
# 	[YEAR1]: "(2011)"
# 	[YEAR2]: "2011"
# 	[QUALITY]: " HD" (or " SD") - extracted from original file name
# 	[RATING]: "PG" - MPAA rating (US)
#	/: A sub-directory (folder) - movies can be in their own directories
# If not specified the format is, "[MOVIE_TITLE] [YEAR2]/[MOVIE_TITLE] [YEAR1]"
rename-movie-format=[MOVIE_TITLE] [YEAR1]/[MOVIE_TITLE] [YEAR1]

# OPTIONAL - renames episodes/movies to replace spaces with dots

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Directory naming
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# OPTIONAL - whether to use directories for seasons 
# For example, should "Show S1E01.avi" be sorted into "Show/Season 1/" or "Show"
# If FALSE, all episodes will be put in the one show directory and season images will not be fetched
# If not specified, TRUE
use-season-directories=TRUE

# OPTIONAL - Season title (eg "Season " -> "Season 1",  "Series "->"Series 1", "Season."->"Season.1")
# Note: if you want a space it needs to be included
# If not specified, "Season "
season-title=Season 

# OPTIONAL - Season format padded to double digits (eg "Season 01" rather than "Season 1")
# TRUE/FALSE
# If not specified, FALSE
season-double-digits=FALSE

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Matching options
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# OPTIONAL - The tolerated variance for year matches.
# This applies to movies and to a lesser extent TV episodes (for sorting purposes).
# For example, if a year is specified in the filename of a movie to sort, it can be off by this many years and still be considered the same movie as one in tmdb database.
# Note that when sorting TV episodes, this is only considered when identifying local directories to sort into, and if a match is not found the year is subsequently ignored.
# If not specified, 1
year-tolerance-for-error=1

# OPTIONAL - Match type. LIBERAL assumes all files are TV episodes and tries to extract season and episode number any way possible.
# Normal is probably what you want
# LIBERAL/NORMAL
# If not specified, NORMAL
match-type=NORMAL

# OPTIONAL - Attempt to sort files that are named after the episode title or air date.
# For example, "My show - My episode title.avi" or "My show - 2010-12-12.avi"
#  could become "My Show - S01E01 - My episode title.avi"
# Attempts to lookup the season and episode number based on the episodes in thetvdb.com database.
# Since this involves downloading the list of episodes from the Internet, this will cause a slower sort.
# TRUE/FALSE
# If not specified, TRUE
match-files-based-on-tvdb-lookups=TRUE

# Use these tvdb IDs to lookup these shows

# Define additional extensions for music files (SortTV knows a lot already)
music-extension=mp3

# OPTIONAL - Attempt to sort entire directories that represent a movie
# The directory (and all its contents AS IS) will be sorted
# Note: Currently, this option WILL NOT rename or sort ANY of the contents of the directory, 
# including the movie. The directory will just be sorted into the movie-directory.
# If not specified, FALSE
sort-movie-directories=FALSE

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Other Behaviour
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# OPTIONAL - Sort by moving or copying the file. If the file already exists because it was already copied it is silently skipped.
# the MOVE-AND-LEAVE-SYMLINK-BEHIND option may be handy if you want to continue to seed after sorting, this leaves a symlink in place of the newly moved file
# PLACE-SYMLINK does not move the original file, but places a symlink in the sort-to directory (probably not what you want).
# PLACE-HARDLINK does not move the original file, but places a hardlink in the sort-to directory. This might be helpful if you use Linux and you want a sorted and unsorted version on the same partition.
# MOVE/COPY/MOVE-AND-LEAVE-SYMLINK-BEHIND/PLACE-SYMLINK/PLACE-HARDLINK
# If not specified, MOVE
sort-by=MOVE

# OPTIONAL - How to treat directories. 
# AS_FILES_TO_SORT - sorts directories, moving entire directories that represents an episode, also detects and moves directories of entire seasons
# RECURSIVELY_SORT_CONTENTS - doesn't move directories, just their contents, including subdirectories
# IGNORE - ignores directories
# AS_FILES_TO_SORT/RECURSIVELY_SORT_CONTENTS/IGNORE
# If not specified, RECURSIVELY_SORT_CONTENTS
treat-directories=RECURSIVELY_SORT_CONTENTS

# OPTIONAL - Only sort into show directories that already exist
# This may be helpful if you have multiple destination directories. Just set up all the other details in the conf file, 
#  and specify the destination directory when invoking the script. Only episodes that match existing directories in the destination will be moved.
# If this is false, then new directories are created for shows that dont have a directory.
# TRUE/FALSE
# If not specified, FALSE
require-show-directories-already-exist=FALSE

# OPTIONAL - Delete symlinks from the directory to sort while sorting.
# This may be helpful if you want to remove all the symlinks you left behind using --sort-by=MOVE-AND-LEAVE-SYMLINK-BEHIND
# You could schedule "perl sorttv.pl --remove-symlinks=TRUE" to remove these once a week/month
# If this option is enabled and used at the same time as --sort-by=MOVE-AND-LEAVE-SYMLINK-BEHIND, 
#  then only the previous links will be removed, and new ones may also be created
# TRUE/FALSE
# If not specified, FALSE
remove-symlinks=FALSE

# OPTIONAL - Forces MSWindows compatible file names, even when run on other platforms such as Linux
# This may be helpful if you are writing to a Windows share from a Linux system
# If not specified, FALSE

# OPTIONAL - Set language for thetvdb and tmdb lookups, this effects episode titles etc
# Valid values include: it, zh, es, hu, nl, pl, sl, da, de, el, he, sv, eng, fi, no, fr, ru, cs, en, ja, hr, tr, ko, pt
# If not specified, en (English)
tv-lookup-language=en

# OPTIONAL - Should non-episode files loose their directory structure?
# This option only has an effect if a non-episode directory was specified.
# If set to TRUE, they will be renamed after the directory they were in.
# Otherwise they keep their directory structure in the new non-episode-directory location.
# TRUE/FALSE
# If not specified, FALSE
flatten-non-eps=FALSE

# OPTIONAL - What to do if a file already exists in the destination
# SKIP/OVERWRITE
# If not specified, SKIP
if-file-exists=SKIP

# OPTIONAL - Only sort TV episodes if the episode name was available from thetvdb
# Note that this only applies if you include the tvdb episode name in the rename format (and have renaming enabled)
# Also note that directories may still be created in the destination, even if the file is skipped due to this rule
# TRUE/FALSE
# If not specified, FALSE
tvdb-episode-name-required=FALSE

# OPTIONAL - Extracts the contents of archives (.zip, .rar) into the directory-to-sort while sorting
# If "rar" and "unzip" programs are available they are used.
# TRUE/FALSE
# If not specified, TRUE
extract-compressed-before-sorting=TRUE

# Optional - Set permissions on new created directories (octal format : 0775)
